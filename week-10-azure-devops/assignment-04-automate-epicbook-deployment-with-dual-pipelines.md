# Assignment 4 — Automate EpicBook Deployment with Dual Pipelines

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will automate the EpicBook infrastructure and application deployment on Microsoft Azure using two repositories and two Azure DevOps pipelines. Terraform will provision the infrastructure, and Ansible will configure the servers, connect EpicBook to Azure Database for MySQL, and deploy the application through Nginx.

---

# Task 0 — Verify Accounts, Tools, and Pipeline Capacity

## Goal

Confirm that the required accounts, tools, pipeline agent, SSH key pair, and Terraform remote-state location are ready.

No submission screenshot is required for this task.

---

# Task 1 — Prepare the Two Repositories

## Goal

Create separate Infrastructure and Application Repositories for the EpicBook deployment.

No submission screenshot is required for this task.

---

# Task 2 — Configure Azure DevOps Connections, Secure Files, and Secrets

## Goal

Configure controlled pipeline access to GitHub, Microsoft Azure, the virtual machines, and Azure Database for MySQL.

No submission screenshot is required for this task.

> Do not expose the Azure Client Secret, SSH private key, MySQL password, access token, subscription ID, or another sensitive value.

---

# Task 3 — Author the Terraform Infrastructure Configuration

## Goal

Define the complete EpicBook Azure infrastructure using Terraform and an Azure Storage remote backend.

No submission screenshot is required for this task.

---

# Task 4 — Author and Run the Infrastructure Pipeline

# Task 5 — Complete the Manual Terraform-to-Ansible Handoff

## Goal

Transfer the required non-sensitive Terraform outputs to the Application Repository for use by Ansible.

No submission screenshot is required for this task.

---

# Task 6 — Author the Ansible Application Configuration

## Goal

Create idempotent Ansible automation that configures the frontend and backend VMs, prepares the database, configures Nginx, and deploys EpicBook.

No submission screenshot is required for this task.

---

# Task 7 — Author and Run the Application Pipeline

## Goal

Run the Application Pipeline to configure the VMs, deploy EpicBook, and verify the application environment.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 3 — Successful Application Pipeline

Add a screenshot of the Application Pipeline run summary showing all required stages or jobs succeeded.

Add your screenshot here.

---

### Screenshot 4 — Successful Ansible Play Recap

Add a screenshot of the Application Pipeline log showing:

* Ansible play recap
* Successful configuration or verification
* Zero failed hosts
* Zero unreachable hosts

Add your screenshot here.

> Do not expose the SSH private key, MySQL password, Client Secret, or complete database connection string.

---

# Task 8 — Verify the Complete EpicBook Workflow

## Goal

Verify that the frontend, backend, and Azure Database for MySQL work together correctly.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 5 — Running EpicBook Application

Add a browser screenshot showing:

* Running EpicBook application
* Frontend public IP address in the browser address bar
* Your Full Name
* Deployment date

The screenshot may show a product, cart, or successful order view.

# Two-Repository Model

Write a short explanation of why separate Infrastructure and Application Repositories were used.

I used two repositories because infrastructure and application code have different owners, different risks and different release cycles. The infrastructure repository (infra-epicbook) holds the Terraform code that builds the network, servers and database on AWS. The application repository (theepicbook) holds the EpicBook source code and the Ansible automation that configures the servers and deploys the app.

Keeping them apart means a change to the website does not touch the infrastructure, and a change to the infrastructure does not redeploy the app. Each repository has its own Git history and its own Azure DevOps pipeline, and each pipeline only gets access to the secrets it needs. For example, only the infrastructure pipeline has the AWS access keys, and only the application pipeline can download the SSH private key. This follows the least privilege principle, and it matches how infrastructure and application teams usually work in real companies.

---

# Manual Terraform-to-Ansible Handoff

Write a short explanation of how the following non-sensitive Terraform outputs were transferred to the Application Repository:

* `app_public_ip`
* `backend_ansible_host`
* `backend_private_ip`
* `mysql_fqdn`

After the Infrastructure Pipeline finished, I opened the Outputs stage of the successful run and read the four non-sensitive values from the "Print infrastructure" step: app_public_ip, backend_ansible_host, backend_private_ip and mysql_fqdn.

I then copied them by hand into the application repository. The two public IPs (app_public_ip and backend_ansible_host) went into the Ansible inventory file (ansible/inventory/hosts.ini), under the frontend and backend groups. The backend_private_ip and mysql_fqdn went into ansible/group_vars/all.yml, where the Nginx template and the database role read them. I committed and pushed these files to the application repository.

Only these four non-sensitive values were moved. No password, access key, token, SSH private key or Terraform state was copied between the repositories. The database username and password stay in an Azure DevOps secret variable group, and the SSH private key stays in Azure DevOps Secure Files.
