# Assignment 1 — Configure a Self-Hosted Azure DevOps Agent on Ubuntu

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will provision an Ubuntu VM in AWS or Azure and configure it as a self-hosted Azure Pipelines agent. You will create an agent pool, register the agent using a Personal Access Token (PAT), run it as a Linux system service, and verify it by executing a test pipeline on the VM.

---

# Task 0 — Create or Access Azure DevOps

## Goal

Sign in to Azure DevOps and create or access an organization and project for the assignment.

No submission screenshot is required for this task.

---

# Task 1 — Create a Personal Access Token (PAT)

## Goal

Create and securely store the PAT required to register the self-hosted agent.

No submission screenshot is required for this task.

> Do not include the PAT in this document or in any screenshot.

---

# Task 2 — Create a Self-Hosted Agent Pool

## Goal

Create the Azure DevOps agent pool that will contain the Linux agent.

No submission screenshot is required for this task.

---

# Task 3 — Provision and Connect to the Ubuntu VM

## Goal

Provision an Ubuntu VM in AWS or Azure and verify its operating system, architecture, and outbound connection to Azure DevOps.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 1 — Ubuntu VM Running

Add a screenshot from AWS or Azure showing:

* Ubuntu VM name
* VM status as **Running**
* Public IP address

---

### Screenshot 2 — Ubuntu, Architecture, and HTTPS Verification

Add an SSH terminal screenshot showing the output of:

* `cat /etc/os-release`
* `uname -m`
* `curl -I https://dev.azure.com`

The screenshot must confirm a supported Ubuntu version, `x86_64` architecture, and a successful HTTP response from Azure DevOps.

# Task 4 — Install and Configure the Azure Pipelines Agent

## Goal

Download, configure, and register the Linux Azure Pipelines agent, and run it as a system service.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 3 — Agent Configuration and Service Status

Add a terminal screenshot showing:

* Successful agent configuration
* Agent service installation
* Agent service start
* `sudo ./svc.sh status` reporting that the service is running

> Ensure that the PAT is not visible.

---

# Task 5 — Verify That the Agent Is Online

## Goal

Confirm that the agent service is running and the agent appears online in Azure DevOps.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 4 — Agent Online in Azure DevOps

Add a screenshot of the Azure DevOps Agent Pool **Agents** page showing:

* Selected agent pool
* Selected agent name
* Agent status as **Online**
* Agent enabled and available

---

# Task 6 — Create and Run a Test Pipeline

## Goal

Create an Azure DevOps YAML pipeline and verify that its commands execute on the self-hosted Ubuntu VM.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 5 — Azure Pipelines YAML

Add a screenshot of `azure-pipelines.yml` open in the Azure Repos editor showing:

* `trigger: none`
* Selected self-hosted agent pool
* Bash verification step
* Your Full Name
* Linux verification commands

---

### Screenshot 6 — Successful Test Pipeline

Add a screenshot of the successful Azure DevOps pipeline run showing:

* Overall status as **Succeeded**
* Expanded **Verify self-hosted Ubuntu agent** step
* `Submitted by: <your-full-name>`
* Agent name
* Machine name
* Output from `uname -a`
* Output from `whoami`
* Output from `df -h`
* Output from `pwd`

## Completed azure-pipelines.yml

Paste the contents of your completed `azure-pipelines.yml` file below.

```yaml
trigger:
- none

pool:
  name: SelfHostedPool

steps:
- script: uname -a
  displayName: 'Show system info'

- script: whoami
  displayName: 'Show current user'

- script: df -h
  displayName: 'Show disk usage'

```

> Do not include your PAT, SSH private key, password, or cloud credentials in the YAML file.

# Assignment Summary

Write a short summary of what you configured.

I set up a self-hosted Azure DevOps agent on a Linux virtual machine in Azure. I downloaded the agent package into a folder called myagent, extracted it, and registered it to an agent pool called SelfHostedPool, so my own VM can run pipeline jobs instead of a Microsoft-hosted machine.

I then wrote a simple YAML pipeline to test it. The pipeline has automatic triggers turned off, so it only runs when I start it manually. It uses SelfHostedPool and runs three commands on the agent: uname -a to show system information, whoami to show the user the agent runs as, and df -h to show disk usage.

If the pipeline runs successfully, it proves the agent is online, connected to Azure DevOps, and able to pick up and run jobs on my VM.
