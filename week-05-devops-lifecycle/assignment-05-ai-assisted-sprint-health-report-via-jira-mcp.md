# Assignment 5 — AI-Assisted Sprint Health Report via Jira MCP

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will connect Claude Code to your Jira board through an MCP server, the same way you connected it to GitHub in Week 2, and build a read-only `/sprint-health` skill. The skill reads your current sprint through Jira's API and reports sprint velocity, stories at risk of missing the sprint, and items missing an estimate — but it must never create, edit, comment on, or transition a single ticket itself. You will prove that boundary holds by making a real change on the board yourself and confirming the skill only ever reports, never acts.

# Task 1 — Create a Jira API Token

## Goal

Generate an API token from your Atlassian account that the MCP server will use to authenticate with your Jira site. Do not screenshot the token value itself.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Jira API token creation confirmation page showing the token name, with the token value not visible

### Notes You Must Write (Very Important):

Why does the MCP server need your site URL and account email in addition to the token?

The API token by itself is not enough for the MCP server to connect to Jira. Jira’s REST API uses Basic Authentication, which requires two pieces of information: your Atlassian email address and your API token.

Each part serves a different purpose. The email address identifies the Atlassian account making the request, while the API token acts as the credential that verifies the account. The Jira site URL then tells the MCP server exactly which Jira instance it should connect to.

This is important because Atlassian hosts many different Jira instances. For example, your-site.atlassian.net is a specific Jira environment belonging to a particular organization or account. So, the token confirms who you are, the email identifies which account you're using, and the URL specifies where the request should be sent.

# Task 2 — Create .mcp.json at the Project Root

## Goal

Create or update `.mcp.json` at your project root with a Jira MCP server block, following the same shape as the GitHub MCP server you configured in Week 2.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — `.mcp.json` open in VS Code showing the Jira server configuration

![Screenshot 2](screenshots/Jira%20sitting%20pretty.png)

### Notes You Must Write (Very Important):

Compare this jira block to the github block from Week 2 Assignment 5. The GitHub server ran via npx (a Node.js package); this one runs via uvx (a Python package) — what stays exactly the same shape despite that difference, and why doesn't Claude Code care which language a given MCP server is written in?

The shape that stays the same is the "command" / "args" / "env" block — every server, whatever it's written in, boils down to "run this executable with these arguments." Claude Code doesn't care about the language because it never touches the source code; it just launches that command and exchanges JSON-RPC messages with it over stdio, per the MCP protocol. As long as the process speaks that protocol correctly, Node, Python, or anything else underneath is invisible to Claude Code.

# Task 3 — Add Your Credentials to settings.local.json

## Goal

Add your Jira site URL, account email, and API token to `.claude/settings.local.json`, and confirm that file is listed in `.gitignore` so it is never committed.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — `settings.local.json` open in VS Code showing the `env` section, with the actual token value blurred or covered

![Screenshot 3](screenshots/settings.json.png)

### Notes You Must Write (Very Important):

Why must JIRA_API_TOKEN live in settings.local.json and never in .mcp.json?

.mcp.json is meant to be committed and shared with the team, while settings.local.json is local-only and gitignored — so putting a real token in .mcp.json would leak it into version control (and to anyone with repo access), whereas settings.local.json keeps it on your machine only.

---

# Task 4 — Verify the Connection with /mcp

## Goal

Restart Claude Code and confirm the Jira MCP server shows as connected.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — `/mcp` output showing `jira: connected`

# Task 5 — Run a Live Query to Prove Real Board Data

## Goal

Ask Claude to list the issues in your current active sprint through the Jira MCP connection, and confirm the result matches what you see on your live board in the browser.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 5 — Claude's response showing the live sprint issue list retrieved via Jira MCP

![Screenshot 5](screenshots/claude%20jira%20report.png)

### Notes You Must Write (Very Important):

How did you confirm this was real board data and not something Claude guessed?

# Task 6 — Build the /sprint-health Skill

## Goal

Create a `/sprint-health` skill restricted to read-only Jira tools plus `Read`, with no issue-mutating tools and no `Write`. Run it and confirm it produces a report covering sprint velocity, at-risk stories, and items missing an estimate.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — `SKILL.md` frontmatter showing `allowed-tools` limited to read-only Jira tools plus `Read`, with `disable-model-invocation: true`

![Screenshot 6](screenshots/Frontmatter.png)

#### Screenshot 7 — `/sprint-health` output showing the full triage report against your real sprint

![Screenshot 7](screenshots/SKILL.png)

### Notes You Must Write (Very Important):

1. Which Jira MCP tools does this skill's allowed-tools list include, and which mutating tools (create issue, update issue, transition issue, add comment) does it deliberately exclude?

The allowed-tools list includes four Jira MCP tools: mcp__jira__jira_search, mcp__jira__jira_get_issue, mcp__jira__jira_get_sprint, and mcp__jira__jira_get_board — plus the general Read tool.

It deliberately excludes the mutatating tools — nothing like jira_create_issue, jira_update_issue, jira_transition_issue, or jira_add_comment appears anywhere in the list. That exclusion is reinforced twice more in the body: step 5 explicitly forbids calling any Jira tool that creates, edits, comments on, or transitions an issue, and step 7 restates that the skill only reports — the Scrum Master acts manually.

2. Why does a Scrum Master need this restriction more than almost any other role in this course?

A Scrum Master touches the whole team's board, not just their own tickets. If Jira access lets the AI make changes and something goes wrong, it doesn't just mess up one person's task, it messes up data everyone relies on for standup and planning. Someone working only on their own issues doesn't carry that same risk, so locking a Scrum Master's skill to read-only matters a lot more here.

# Task 7 — Prove the Skill Never Mutates the Board

## Goal

Manually update one ticket on your board in the browser (for example, move a story to "Done" or add a missing estimate), then run `/sprint-health` again and confirm the new report reflects your change — proving the skill only ever reads live state and never wrote to the board itself.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 8 — Second `/sprint-health` run showing the report now reflects your manual board change

![Screenshot 8](screenshots/sprinthealthreport.png)

### Notes You Must Write (Very Important):

Map this assignment to Gather → Analyze → Human Act → Verify from Week 3 Assignment 6. Which step did you perform manually in the browser, and why must that step stay human?

Gather: The sprint-health skill reads Jira via MCP tools, search, get issue, get sprint, get board, pulling status, assignees, points, and timestamps.

Analyze: It calculates velocity, flags at-risk stories, and finds items missing estimates, then produces a report with a suggested talking point.

Human Act: This is the step that happens manually in the Jira browser interface, not through AI. A person reads the report and decides whether to actually move a ticket to "Done," add a comment, or transition an issue's status. That's the step you'd do by logging into Jira yourself and clicking through it.

Verify: The human (or team) checks that the change reflects reality, that the ticket really is done, that the comment is accurate, before moving on.

That step must stay human because moving a ticket or commenting on it is a decision with real consequences for the whole team's board. It needs someone's judgment and accountability behind it, not an AI acting on inferred intent.
