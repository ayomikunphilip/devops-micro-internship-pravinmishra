# Assignment 6 — Building an AI-Assisted Git Safety Net (PR Ready Check)

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In Week 2 you built Claude Code hooks that block a dangerous action *before* it happens (`PreToolUse`), and a restricted skill that could look but not touch (`allowed-tools` without `Write`). In this assignment you will discover that Git has the exact same idea, decades older: a **pre-commit hook** that blocks a commit before it's created.

You will build both halves of a real "PR Ready" workflow:

1. A **Git hook that follows fixed rules** — scans staged changes for hardcoded secrets and oversized files and refuses the commit. No AI involved, no guessing, just a rule that gives the same answer every time.
2. A **restricted Claude Code skill** (`/pr-ready`) that reads your staged diff and drafts a Pull Request title, description, and a short list of things worth a second look — the kind of judgment a fixed rule can't make (mixed changes, missing context, unclear intent). The skill never commits, pushes, or opens the PR. You do that yourself, using its draft as a starting point.

This mirrors the Agentic Loop from Week 3's Linux triage assignment: **Gather → Analyze → Human Act → Verify**. The hook and the skill both gather and analyze; only you act.

# Task 0 — Confirm Your Fork and Create a Feature Branch

## Goal

Confirm you are working in your own fork, then create a dedicated branch for this assignment.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Output of git remote -v and git branch showing the new branch

![Screenshot 1](screenshots/remote_v_branch.png)

---

### Notes

**1. Why create a dedicated branch instead of doing this work on main?**

A dedicated branch keeps this assignment separate from the main branch, making it safer to develop, test, and review changes without affecting the original work. It also makes it easy to open a Pull Request containing only the assignment work and avoids mixing unrelated changes into the main branch.

---

# Task 1 — Stage a Change With Realistic Risk

## Goal

On your own fork of this repository (the one you've been submitting your DMI work in since onboarding), create a new branch and stage a change that a real reviewer should catch: a hardcoded-looking secret and a leftover debug statement.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Output of  `git status` showing the staged file on feature/ai-pr-ready

![Screenshot](screenshots/staged.png)

---

### Notes

**1. Why does this assignment use an obviously fake key instead of a real one?**

The assignment uses an obviously fake key so you can safely test the pre-commit hook without exposing a real credential. This demonstrates how the hook detects secret-like patterns while ensuring no actual authentication secret is ever committed or shared.

---

# Task 2 — Write a Real Git Pre-Commit Hook

## Goal

Create a tracked, shareable pre-commit hook that blocks a commit containing secret-like patterns or files over 1MB.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — `hooks/pre-commit` open in VS Code showing the full script

![Screenshot 2](screenshots/Full-script.png)

---

#### Screenshot 3 — Output of `git config core.hooksPath` confirming it points to `hooks`

![Screenshot 3](screenshots/config_hooks.png)

---

### Notes

**1. Why is `hooks/pre-commit` tracked in the repo instead of living only in `.git/hooks/`?**

hooks/pre-commit is tracked in the repository so every team member gets the same pre-commit checks when they configure core.hooksPath to use the shared hooks directory. If the hook existed only in .git/hooks/, it would remain a local Git configuration that is not version-controlled or shared with others, leading to inconsistent enforcement across the team.

---

**2. Compare this to `PreToolUse` from Week 2 Assignment 6. What does each one intercept, and what do they have in common?**

The hooks/pre-commit script intercepts Git commit attempts and checks the staged files before a commit is created, blocking commits that contain secret-like patterns or oversized files. PreToolUse from Week 2 Assignment 6 intercepts tool requests before the AI is allowed to execute them. What they have in common is that they both act as preventive safety gates, stopping risky actions before they happen instead of trying to fix problems afterward.

---

# Task 3 — Prove the Hook Blocks the Risky Commit

## Goal

Attempt to commit the staged file from Task 1 and show the hook rejecting it.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Terminal showing `git commit` rejected with the hook's "BLOCKED" message naming the exact file

![Screenshot 4](screenshots/Commit_blocked.png)

---

### Notes

**1. Which line in `hooks/pre-commit` matched your fake key, and why did it match?**

The fake key was matched by the line that searches for key patterns using grep. The hook looks for strings that begin with the AKIA prefix followed by a fixed number of uppercase letters and numbers. Since the test value AKIAABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP follows that pattern, the regular expression matched it and the commit was blocked.

---

**2. Could this hook have caught a poorly-named variable that stores a secret without the `AKIA` prefix? What does that tell you about the limits of a fixed rule like this?**

No. This hook would not necessarily catch a secret stored in a poorly named variable if the secret did not match one of its predefined patterns, such as the AKIA prefix. That shows the limitation of a fixed-rule approach: it can only detect what it has been explicitly programmed to look for, so secrets with different formats or patterns may be missed. 

---

# Task 4 — Build the `/pr-ready` Skill

## Goal

Create a manually invoked Claude Code skill that reads your staged changes and produces a PR-readiness report and a draft PR description — without writing, committing, or pushing anything itself.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 5 — `SKILL.md` frontmatter showing `allowed-tools: Bash, Read, Grep` (no `Write`) and `disable-model-invocation: true`

![Screenshot 5](screenshots/frontmatter.png)

---

#### Screenshot 6 — `/pr-ready` output while the risky file is still staged, showing it flagged the secret and/or debug statement

![Screenshot 6](screenshots/staged_claude_blocked.png)

---

### Notes

**1. Why does `/pr-ready` have `Bash` and `Read` but not `Write`?**

/pr-ready has permission to use Bash and Read because it needs to inspect the repository, run Git commands, and examine files to gather evidence for its Pull Request review. It does not have Write because its role is to analyze and report, not to modify the repository. This keeps the AI in an advisory role, leaving any code changes or fixes to the human user.

---

**2. The pre-commit hook and `/pr-ready` both looked at the same staged diff. Did they flag the same things? What did one catch that the other didn't?**

No. The pre-commit hook caught fixed-rule issues like the fake secret, while /pr-ready also identified broader PR quality issues such as documentation, tests, and overall readiness.

---

# Task 5 — Fix the Issues and Re-Verify

## Goal

Remove the secret and debug statement, then prove both gates now pass clean.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 7 — `git commit` succeeding after the fix (no BLOCKED message)

![Screenshot 7](screenshots/comm_succ.png)

---

#### Screenshot 8 — Second `/pr-ready` run showing a clean risk report and a drafted PR title + description

![Screenshot 8](screenshots/real_claude_draft.png)

---

### Notes

**1. What exactly did you change to satisfy the pre-commit hook?**

I removed the fake hardcoded secret and any debug code from the staged changes so the repository no longer violated the hook's fixed rules, allowing the commit to pass.

---

# Task 6 — Push and Open a Pull Request Using the AI Draft

## Goal

Push your branch and open a real Pull Request, using `/pr-ready`'s drafted title and description as your starting point — read it critically and edit before you use it.

**Important:** Open this Pull Request with base repository set to **your own fork** — not the shared upstream `pravinmishraaws/devops-micro-internship-pravinmishra` repository. This assignment's hook and skill files are your own practice work, not a change meant for the shared class repo.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 9 — Your Pull Request showing the base repository is your own fork, plus the title and description, with the `/pr-ready` draft visible for comparison (paste it in the PR conversation or your notes below)

#### PR Link

https://github.com/pravinmishraaws/devops-micro-internship-pravinmishra/pull/62

---

### Notes

**1. What, if anything, did you edit in the AI's drafted PR description before using it? Why?**

I didn't edit the AI's drafted PR description because it was already accurate, clear, and reflected the changes I made. I reviewed it before using it to ensure it matched my work.

---

**2. If you had blindly copy-pasted the AI's draft without reading it, what could go wrong?**

I could have submitted an inaccurate or misleading PR description that didn't match my actual changes. Reviewing it first ensured it was correct before using it.

---

**3. Why does this PR need to target your own fork instead of the shared upstream repository?**

The PR targets my own fork so I can safely submit and review my changes without affecting the shared upstream repository used by others.

---

# Task 7 — Map the Workflow to the Agentic Loop

## Goal

Explain this assignment's workflow using the same Gather → Analyze → Human Act → Verify structure from Week 3.

### Notes

**1. Which step(s) represent Gather?**

Gather is represented by the steps where the pre-commit hook scans the staged files and where /pr-ready reads the staged diff and repository information before performing any analysis.

---

**2. Which step(s) represent Analyze?**

Analyze is the step where /pr-ready evaluates the gathered information and produces findings and recommendations about the Pull Request.

---

**3. Which step is Human Act, and why must a human — not Claude — run `git commit`, `git push`, and open the PR?**

Human Act is when I review the AI's recommendations and manually run git commit, git push, and open the PR. A human must perform these actions because they change the repository and require human approval and accountability.

---

**4. Which step is Verify?**

Verify is the final step where I confirm the commit succeeds, push the branch, and ensure the Pull Request is created correctly after the changes are made.

---

**5. In one or two sentences: why do you need *both* the fixed-rule pre-commit hook and the AI skill? Isn't one enough?**

No. The pre-commit hook catches specific rule-based issues, while the AI skill provides broader context-aware review. Together, they catch different types of problems and improve code quality.

---

# Task 8 — LinkedIn Post

## Goal

Publish a LinkedIn post summarizing what you built and what you learned about combining fixed-rule safety checks with AI-assisted review.
